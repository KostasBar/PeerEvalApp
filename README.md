## About the Project
PeerEvalApp was created as the final assignment for [Coding Factory](https://codingfactory.aueb.gr/). It is a Full Stack App that allows employees of a company to evaluate each other. Each employee can have a record of their evaluation grades from completed evaluation cycles. The project provided an excellent opportunity to explore the Model-First development pattern in the backend using .NET and to gain practical experience with Angular in the frontend. This was my first approach to web development in a personal project context, expanding my skills in both designing and implementing functional user interfaces and robust backend solutions.

## Features
- **User Management**  
  - Create and update users (Admin vs. User roles).

- **Evaluation Cycles**  
  - Admins open/close cycles; Users view active cycles and submit peer evaluations.

- **Peer Evaluations**  
  - Rate colleagues within the same team; track completed evaluations.

- **Historical Data**  
  - View past cycles, results, and performance over time.

- **Auth & Authorization**  
  - Distinguish Admin powers (managing data) from User capabilities (evaluations).

- **Extensibility**  
  - Layered architecture (Controllers, Services, Repos) for easy feature addition.
